# Raycast - Convert Google Drive path

## How the script works
If you are on the Finder and on a Google Drive folder, then convert the Mac path to a Windows path and put the converted path to the clipboard
If you are not on the finder and you have a Google Drive link in the clipboard, convert the Windows path to Mac path

## How to use it
1. Install Raycast https://www.raycast.com/
2. Open the script and replace :
mail@mail.com with your mail address
If your Mac is in french, replace "Shared drives" with "Drive partageÃÅs"
