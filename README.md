# Raycast - Convert Google Drive path

## How the script works
If you are on the Finder and on a Google Drive folder, then convert the MAC path to a WINDOWS path, and put the converted path to the clipboard

If you are not on the Finder and you have a WINDOWS Google Drive path in the clipboard, convert the WINDOWS path to MAC path and open in on the Finder

## How to install
1. Install Raycast https://www.raycast.com/
2. Open Raycast (option + space), under Extensions create a new Script Command

3. Template is Bash, mode Silent, Title "Path" and save it where you want, for example Documents (you'll have to edit the file):

4. Open the script and replace :

mail="*my_email*" with your mail address

For example : mail="jdeslandes@datawords.com"

5. Save the file

That's it, you can call the script using opt + space and type "path"

If you're on the Finder with on the drive, it will convert the path to WINDOWS path and put it on the clipboard

If you're not on the Finder and on you have a WINDOWS path on your clipboard, it will convert the path to MAC and open it on the finder
